## Create CAP Project and Fiori List Report App based on Image

1. In the Cline panel, choose **Plan Mode**.

    ![plan mode](./images/plan-mode.png)

2. Download image [listreport](./images/list-report-page.png).

    ![download](./images/download.png)

3. Drag and drop image(list-report-page.png) to Explorer.

    ![explorer](./images/explorer.png)

4. Copy and paste the following prompt into the task input:  
   ```
   Generate a new CAP project and SAP Fiori app based on Image @/list-report-page.png 
   Include technical key and business key for all entities.
   Use MCP servers and follow all rules.
   ```

5. Press `Enter` to execute the task.

6. Cline prepares an **Implementation Plan** using the AI model and MCP servers.
   - During preparation, **Cline may request** approval to use MCP servers.
   - Click **Approve**.

   ![cds mcp approval](./images/cds-mcp-approve-req.png)

   - After executing 20 API requests Cline needs manual approval click to proceed.

    ![autoapprove task](./images/autoapprove-task.png)

    **If you face terminal issue as shown below**
    - Cline remains pending and commands (such as `npm install`) are not executed in the VS Code terminal.
    
    Solution: Toggle between **Act** and **Plan** mode, then click `Resume Task`.

     ![terminal](./images/terminal-pending.png)

     Solution:
   
     ![resume task](./images/task-resume.png)

- Cline may ask additional questions to prepare the plan. Enter the following information only if cline asks for it:
    1. Would you like to specify a project name? `travel-management`
    2. Would you like to provide a Fiori app name? `process-travels`
    3. Would you like to include sample data? `yes`
    4. Would you like to specify any additional features beyond what's shown in Image? `no additional features required beyond Image`

6. Once the implementation plan is ready, review it.

> [!Note]
> The implementation plan generated by Cline may differ from the example shown below. Below image is just for reference.

   ![implementation plan](./images/implementation-plan.png)

7. Switch to **Act mode**.

8. Cline executes the implementation plan with the following steps:  

    **Monitor the execution process and manually approve Cline requests whenever prompted to proceed**
    ---

   - Cline runs the command automatically to initialize your CAP project:
     ```
     cds init travel-management
     ```
   - Uses the cds-mcp server to generate the data model and service. When prompted, click **Approve** to allow this action.

   - Before saving the generated data model to your project, Cline will ask you to review and confirm the content. Click **Save** to proceed. 

> [!NOTE]
> To Auto-approve future save requests -> Activate both `Edit project files` and `Edit all files` as shown below.

    ![edit file autoapprove](./images/edit-file-autoapprove.png)

   - Cline creates sample data files automatically (in .csv format) for your project.

   - After the app is generated successfully, Cline installs all required dependencies for your project:

     `cd <project-name> && npm install`
   - Finally, Cline starts the application for you:

     `cd <project-name> && npm run watch-<project-name>`
---

9. After completing all the planned steps, the application should automatically open in your browser, displaying a travel list report application that matches the Image.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows security may ask  'Do you want to allow public and private network to access this app'. Click on `Allow`

## Troubleshoot

1) Application preview does not open automatically in the browser:

   - Close current task and start new task.
   - Enter prompt `Preview application`
   - If the issue still exists, then you can start watch script manually.
      - Open the `package.json` file.
      - Right click on watch script and select `Run Script`.

   ![watch script](./images/watch-script.png)

2) If the application prompts for authentication, use username: `dummy` and password: `dummy`

3) In the browser, If your application does not load or displays a blank page:

- Open Developer Tools in your browser to check the error message.
  - Windows: Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`
  - Mac: Press `Cmd + Option + I`

    ![developer tools](./images/developer-tools.png)

- For a 404 error, enter the prompt:  
    `Error: Could not load metadata: 404 Not Found`
  - Press `Enter` and Cline will fix the service URL path issue.

- For a 200 error, enter the prompt:  
    `Check if the EDM JSON expression ($edmJson) syntax is incorrect and validate it using CAP MCP.`
- If the issue still exists, enter this prompt:
    `Remove all instances of EDM JSON ($edmJson) expression syntax from the code.`
