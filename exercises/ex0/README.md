2. To add a global rule, enter a rule name `fioriRules` and click the + icon as shown in screenshot above.
3. File `fioriRules.md` is opened in the editor panel.
4. Copy and paste following rules.

```
## Rules for creation or modification of SAP Fiori elements apps

- When asked to create an SAP Fiori elements app check whether the user input can be interpreted as an application organized into one or more pages containing table data or forms, these can be translated into a SAP Fiori elements application, else ask the user for suitable input.
- The application typically starts with a List Report page showing the data of the base entity of the application in a table. Details of a specific table row are shown in the ObjectPage. This first Object Page is therefore based on the base entity of the application.
- An Object Page can contain one or more table sections based on to-many associations of its entity type. The details of a table section row can be shown in an another Object Page based on the associations target entity.
- The data model must be suitable for usage in a SAP Fiori elements frontend application. So there must be one main entity and one or more navigation properties to related entities.
- Each property of an entity must have a proper datatype.
- For all entities in the data model provide primary keys of type UUID (technical key) and ID (business key) fields.
- When creating sample data in CSV files, all primary keys and foreign keys MUST be in UUID format (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001`).
- When generating or modifying the SAP Fiori elements application on top of the CAP service use the Fiori MCP server if available.
- When attempting to modify the SAP Fiori elements application like adding columns you must not use the screen personalization but instead modify the code of the project, before this first check whether an MCP server provides a suitable function.
- When previewing the SAP Fiori elements application use the most specific `npm run watch-*` script for the app in the `package.json`. If `npm run watch-*` script is already opened/running in a terminal, do not start another terminal window.
- MUST NOT use `npm start`, `npm run start`, `cds serve`, `cds-serve`, `sleep`.
- Must not open http://localhost:4004/ after lauching preview
- After launching the application stop and wait for user commands
```

5. Save file `fioriRules.md`.
6. Add another global rule `cdsRules` and click the + icon.
7. File `cdsRules.md` is opened in editor panel.
8. Copy and paste following rules.

```
- You MUST search for CDS definitions, like entities, fields and services (which include HTTP endpoints) with cds-mcp, only if it fails you MAY read \*.cds files in the project.
- You MUST search for CAP docs with cds-mcp EVERY TIME you create, modify CDS models or when using APIs or the `cds` CLI from CAP. Do NOT propose, suggest or make any changes without first checking it.
- When creating new CAP project ask cds mcp server. while using cds init, do not include any --add options (e.g., --add hana, --add sqlite, --add tiny-sample, etc.). Only use the plain form: cds init
- You MUST NOT use EDM JSON syntax for CDS.
```

9. Save file `cdsRules.md`.

## Summary

With the setup procedure done, you now have completed:

- Access to SAP Business Application Studio
- Creation of your development space
- Configure AI client - Cline
